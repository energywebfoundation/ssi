# Introduction
DIDs and VCs have specifications that seem stable enough to demonstrate the first use cases. However, there is a multitude of ways to integrate these technologies and IT teams need to become proficient in a field that is currently poorly documented, making the use of the technology costly and not always compatible between different implementations.

## Main goal
Our main goal is to provide an API that is complete enough to abstract the complexity of the technology for the developer. By choosing to work with the same technology stack at first, we reduce the risk of interoperability issues in our use cases. 
We have taken particular care in choosing the underlying technologies to make our building blocks usable both on the server side and for the creation of a mobile application for the consumer. 

# Opensource
The entire framework is open source and easily deployable so that our partners can use this technology with the lowest possible barrier to entry. We also offer training in the use of the framework for a quick start in the best conditions.
