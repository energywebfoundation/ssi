# Verificable Credentials Contexts

## Contexts in the VC Specification

See the [Contexts section](w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts) of the specification for more generation information about context in VCs.

## Loading Contexts in Credentials

Though contexts are indentified by URLs, for security and privacy it is best to load contexts from local copies.
DIDKit, the SSI library which this implementation of VC-API uses, only supports contexts which are built into library.
For more information on this, see the [DIDKit documentation on document loading](https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/document-loading/).

Given the need to re-build DIDKit in order to add a new context, it is not possible with this current implementation of VC-API
to issue or verify a credential which refers a context which has is not in the DIDKit [default contexts](https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/tree/main/contexts).
However, it is possible to use a new context by including the context inline into the credential.

### In-line contexts

Rather than referencing a context via a URI in a JSON-LD `@context` array, it is possible to include the context directly in-line.

For example, a veriable credential may contain a `@context` array as follows:
```json
{
   "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      {
         "custom": "https://example.com/custom-context-2022#",
         "customObject": {
            "@id": "custom:customObject",
            "@type": "custom:ExampleObject"
         },
         "customField": "custom:customField"
      }
   ],
   "id": "urn:uuid:7f94d397-3e70-4a43-945e-1a13069e636f",
   "type": [
      "VerifiableCredential"
   ],
   "credentialSubject":{
      "id": "did:example:123",
      "customObject": {
        "customField": "customValue"
      }
   },
   "issuer": "did:example:456",
   "issuanceDate": "2022-03-18T08:57:32.477Z"
}
```
